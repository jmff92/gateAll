Plant tissues at different growth stages from young seedling to maturity can be used for DNA isolation. 
1.	A healthy leaf blade (about 2 cm long) is collected in 1.5 ml tube. 
2.	The tube is capped and placed on ice. 
3.	The leaf tissue is cut into half cm long and placed in a well of spot test plate (Thomas Scientific). 
4.	Four hundred µl of extraction buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 8.0, EDTA 25 mM, NaCl 300 mM, SDS 1 %) is added. 
5.	The tissue is ground using a thick glass rod as a pestle. 
6.	Again 400µl of the extraction buffer added, mixed and 400µl of it is transferred into the original 1.5ml tube. 
7.	Then 400µl chloroform (containing 4% V/V isoamyl alcohol) is added and mixed well, spun for 30 seconds in microcentrifuge. 
8.	Care is taken not to disturb the interface. The supernatant is transferred to another 1.5ml tube. 
9.	To the supernatant, 800µl absolute alcohol is added and mixed gently. 
10.	The tube is spun for 3 min in microcentrifuge with full speed and the supernatant is decanted. 
11.	The pellet is washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. 
12.	DNA is suspended in 50µl of TE (Tris-HCI 10 mM, pH 8.0, EDTA 1 mM) and then stored at -20C.
