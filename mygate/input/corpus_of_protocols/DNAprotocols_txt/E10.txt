MacManes Salt Extraction Protocol 
Typical yield (5ug genomic DNA) 

Digest Tissue: 
a.  Tissue + 410µL extraction buffer + 2% SDS (80 µL 10% SDS) + 20µL Proteinase K (10mg/ml) 
b.  Digest overnight (or until tissue dissolved) at temperature of preference (55º usually). 
Extraction Step 1- Get rid of excess protein.  
a.  Centrifuge 3 minutes at 13,000rpm 
b.  Transfer supernatant to new eppi. Discard pellet. 
Extraction Step 2- Get rid of salts.  
a.  Add 200µL NaCl to supernatant from step 1. 
b.  Vortex above mixture. 
c.  Centrifuge mixture (at 4º) from step one- 7 minutes, 13,000rpm 
Extraction Step 3- Precipitate DNA 
a.  Transfer supernatant from step 2 quickly to new eppi. 
b.  Add 500 µL chilled isopropanol. 
c.  Gently mix. 
d.  Cool on Ice x 10 minutes   
e.  Centrifuge mixture (at 4º) from step two- 10 minutes, 13,000+rpm 
Extraction Step 4- Wash DNA-1 
a.  Carefully discard supernatant from step 3- (might see pellet at this point) 
b.  Add 500µL 70-80% ethanol 
c.  Mix gently. 
d.  Cool on dry for a few minutes 
e.  Centrifuge mixture (at 4º) from step three- 10 minutes, 13,000+rpm 
Extraction Step 5- Wash DNA-2 
a.  Carefully discard supernatant from step 4. 
b.  Add 500µL 70-80% ethanol 
c.  Mix gently 
d.  Cool on Ice x few minutes 
e.  Centrifuge mixture (at 4º) from step three- 10 minutes, 13,000+rpm 
Extraction Step 6- Dry Pellet 
a.  Discard Supernatant from step 5.  
b.  Dry Pellet via method of choice. (vacuum centrifuge is best) 
Extraction Step 7- rehydrate DNA 
a.  Rehydrate DNA in 50µL TE buffer (or buffer of choice) 
b.  Let sit overnight to completely rehydrate. 
c.  Quantify DNA using nanodrop
