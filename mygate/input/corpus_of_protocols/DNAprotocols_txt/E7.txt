DNA EXTRACTION OF RICE (Based on method of Dellaporta)

Collection and storage of tissue
1.	Harvest leaves from greenhouse. It is preferable to use young leaves without necrotic areas or lesions.
2.	Collect the leaves into aluminium foil with the tag identifying the sample. Place the samples in a container with ice to keep samples cool. Make sure samples do not get wet.
3.	The samples may be frozen and stored at -80C or place leaf samples in liquid nitrogen.
4.	The tissue is grinded in a mortar using a pestle and liquid nitrogen until very fine powder is obtained. In this step, plant cells are disrupted to release the DNA.
5.	0,2 grams of the grinded tissue are collected into a microcentrifuge tube. 
6.	The samples may be frozen and stored at -80C or place leaf samples in a container with ice.

Extraction of DNA
1.	Add 940ul of pre-heated buffer solution (65C) to each sample. This buffer solution contains detergent and salts, that help to the solubilization of proteins and disruption of cell walls. 
2.	Incubate the samples in water bath at 65C for 30 minutes and shake every 5-10 minutes. 
3.	To remove proteins and carbohydrates add 400ul of 5M Potassium Acetate (KCl), ice-cold.
4.	Incubate the samples in an ice bath for 15 minutes while shaking.
5.	Centrifugate at 10.000 rpm for 10 minutes. 
6.	Transfer supernatant (which contains the DNA) to a new 2ml microcentrifuge tube.
7.	To precipitate the DNA add ice-cold 700ul Isopropropanol and 100ul 3M Sodium acetate pH 5.2.
8.	Incubate at -20C, for 45 minutes or 1 hour. (at this step DNA extraction can be stopped and continued next day if necessary)
9.	Centrifugate at 13.000 rpm for 5 minutes. 
10.	To clean the DNA, Add 400ul ethanol 70%, ice-cold. 
11.	Centrifugate at 12.000 rpm for 3 minutes. 
12.	Discard the supernatant and dry the pellet at room temperature, in a speedvac for 10 min. or incubate for 30 min to 37C.
13.	Dissolve the DNA in 60ul of TE buffer with RNAse enzyme to remove RNA. 
14.	Once diluted, DNA quality can be checked in agarose gels and its concentration can be determined.
