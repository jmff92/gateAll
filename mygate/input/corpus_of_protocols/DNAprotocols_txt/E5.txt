Comparison and optimization of ancient DNA extraction 

Initial comparison of different methods using ~40mg sample material 

1a.1 Silica method (1) 
1. 40 mg of powder were digested in 1ml buffer composed of 0.45M EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1% PVP, 50mM DTT, 2.5mM PTB and 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 37C in the dark. 
2. After centrifugation, the supernatant was added to 4ml binding buffer (L2: 5M GuSCN, 25mM NaCl, 50mM Tris (pH 8.0)) plus 15ul silica suspension (prepared according to (2), using silica from Sigma [ordering number: S5631]) and incubated under agitation for one hour at room temperature.
3. The silica pellet was collected via centrifugation, the supernatant discarded and the pellet washed once with binding buffer and once with NewWash solution (see 3.8 for preparation, Qbiogene, USA). 
4. Subsequently, the pellet was dried at 56C for 7min.
5. DNA was eluted with 50ul 1xTE at 56C for 10min, and after centrifugation, the aqueous solution was transferred to a new tube. 

1a.2 Centricons 
1. 40 mg of powder were incubated as described above. 
2. After centrifugation, the supernatant was added to 1ml phenol (pH 8.0), gently mixed and centrifuged for 3min. This step was repeated once.
3. The aqueous phase was added to 1ml Ready Red (Chloroform / Isoamylalcohol, Qbiogene), mixed and centrifuged again for 3min. 
4. Thereafter, the aqueous phase was added to Centricon YM 30 (MWCO 30,000; Millipore, USA) filter devices and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm until ~50ul remained. 
5. This solution was washed twice with 100ul 1xTE by centrifugation. 
6. The remaining ~50ul extract were transferred using inverse centrifugation of the filter into a new tube. 

1a.3 Phenol chloroform (3) 
1. 40 mg of powder were decalcified in 2ml 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) at room temperature overnight. 
2. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet was digested by incubation at 37C overnight in 1ml extraction buffer composed of 10mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 50mM DTT, 0.25mg/ml proteinase K and 2.5mM PTB (concentrations of DTT, proteinase K and PTB were taken from (1), as the concentrations are omitted in (3)). 
3. After centrifugation, the supernatant was added to 1ml phenol (pH 8.0), gently mixed and centrifuged for 3min. This step was then repeated. 
4. The aqueous phase was added to 1ml Ready Red, gently mixed and centrifuged for 3min. 
5. Then the aqueous phase was added to Centricon YM 30 filter devices, and the solution was concentrated via centrifugation at 5,000 rpm.
6. The solution was washed twice with 200ul 1xTE. 
7. The remaining ~50ul extract were transferred by inverse centrifugation of the filter using a new tube. 

1a.4 User-developed protocol: Isolation of genomic DNA from compact bone using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) 
1. 40 mg of powder were decalcified in 2ml 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) at room temperature overnight. 
2. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed with 1ml ddH2O, centrifuged and again the supernatant discarded. 
3. 360ul buffer ATL and 40ul proteinase K were added to the pellet. 
4. This mixture was incubated under agitation for one hour at 56C until lysis of the pellet was complete. 
5. After vortexing, 400ul buffer AL were added, and the mixture was incubated at 70C for 10min. 
6. 400ul ethanol absolute and 3ng of DNA size marker serving as a carrier were added, and the samples were gently mixed. 
7. The mixture was pipetted onto DNeasy spin columns and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 1min. 
8. The flow-through was discarded, and the remaining mixture was pipetted to the columns and centrifuged again. 
9. Following this step, the column was washed once with 500ul buffer AW1, once with 500 ul AW2, and then centrifuged for 3min at 14,000rpm until it was dry. 
10. 50ul of buffer AE were added, incubated for 1min at room temperature and centrifuged for 1min at 8,000rpm. 
11. This flow-through represents the extract. 

1a.5 “DNA-Präparation aus Knochen” with All-tissue DNA-Kit (GEN-IAL GmbH, Germany) 
1. 40 mg of bone powder were decalcified overnight in 2ml 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) at room temperature. 
2. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 1ml ddH2O, centrifuged and the supernatant again discarded. 
3. 1ml Lyse1 buffer, 100ul Lyse 2, 3mg DTT and 15ul proteinase K were added to the pellet and incubated for about one hour at 56C under agitation until the pellet was completely dissolved. 
4. 750ul Lyse 3 buffer were added, vortexed, incubated at -20C for 5min and centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 20min. 
5. The supernatant (~1.8ml) was transferred to a fresh tube and 0.8 volume of isopropanol, plus 10ng of a DNA size marker as a carrier were added. 
6. To precipitate the DNA, the mixture was centrifuged for 15min at 13,000rpm.
7. The supernatant was removed and 300ul ice cold 70% ethanol were added and centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 5min. 
8. The liquid was discarded and the DNA pellet dried at 56C for 5min. 
9. The DNA was dissolved in 50ul 1xTE. 

1a.6 Bone Extraction Protocol to be used with the DNA IQ System (Promega, USA). 
1. 40 mg of powder were incubated in 1ml proteinase K digestion buffer composed of 10mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10mM NaCl, 50mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% SDS and 1mg/ml proteinase K for one hour at 56C under agitation. 
2. 2ml Lysis buffer (including 10mM DTT) and 15ul of Resin (magnetic particles) were added to the supernatant. 
3. After incubation at room temperature for 10min with frequent mixing of the solution, the Resin was collected using the Magnetic Stand. 
4. The supernatant was removed and again 100ul Lysis buffer were added, vortexed, the Resin separated, the solution removed and 100ul Wash buffer added. 
5. After vortexing, separation and removal of the liquid, this washing step was repeated twice. 
6. The Resin was then air dried for 15min in the Magnetic Stand. 
7. 50ul 1xTE were added, vortexed and DNA was eluted for 5min at 65C. 
8. The separated supernatant represents the extract. 

2.7 Sample preparation technique 
The sample was prepared prior to incubation in the extraction  buffer.  
Either the powder was prepared using a freezer mill or part of the compact sample was ground to a more or less coarse-grained “powder” using a mortar and pestle.
