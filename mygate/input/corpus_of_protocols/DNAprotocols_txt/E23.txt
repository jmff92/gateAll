DNA isolation protocol for Vigna radiata with free of phenolics (protocolExchange)

1) Grind the leaves with 600 µl of CTAB buffer, transfer into an eppendorf tube and incubate for 30 min. at 65C with occasional mixing after adding PVP and mercaptoethanol.
2) Remove the tubes from the water bath and allow to cool at room temperature.
3) Add equal volume of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol mixture (24:1) and mix by inversion for 15 min.
4) Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 20 min and transfer the clear aqueous phase to a new sterile tube.
5) Add equal volume of phenol: chloroform (1:1. Centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and transfer the clear aqueous phase to a new sterile tube. 
6) Add 1/3 volume of ice­cold isopropanol and 3M Sodium acetate and mix gently by inversion.
7) Then, centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 20 min to pellet the DNA and discard the supernatant.
8) Wash the DNA pellet with 70 per cent alcohol. After washing with 70% alcohol air dry the DNA pellet.
9) Discard the alcohol and air dry the DNA pellet completely. Depending upon the size of the pellet, dissolve the DNA in 100­200 µl of 1X TE (pH 8.0) and store at 4 C.
