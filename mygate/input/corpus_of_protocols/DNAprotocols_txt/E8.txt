Rapid DNA Extraction from Plants (C. NEAL STEWART, JR)
1. Harvest between 0.02 and 0.2  g  fresh leaf, callus, embryo(or appropriate animal tissue) into a microfuge tube. Place on ice. These may be  sufficiently stable for hours to days, depending upon species.
Note: For plants, best quality  and yield is obtained when newlyflushing leaves are used. However, the procedure has been used with a plethora of tissues, including herbarium specimens.
Caution: All subsequent steps should be performed in a fumehood.
2. Aliquot 500 ul of homogenization buffer (including the 2-mercaptoethanol) into each microfuge tube. For tough leaves from woody plants (exemplified by oaks or cranberry) heating the buffer to 65C may increase yield.
3. Chuck pestle directly onto drill and homogenize tissue. The disposable pestles may be reused after decontamination with 100/<1 commercial bleach followed by subsequent washes with water.
4. Incubate tubes at 65C for 5-60 min. The incubation time is not crucial for most species and can be determined by investigator convenience.
5. Add 500 ul extraction solution to tubes and mix. For most plant species this may consist of ten inversions. For recalcitrant species (such as woody plants) placing tubes horizontally on a shaker (500  rpm) for 5-10 min may increase yield.
6. Centrifuge at 3000g for 5 min. Slightly higher g or longer centrifugation periods may be necessary to keep the interface compact and the top layer clear if many (>12) samples are centrifuged at a time.
7. Pipette top (aqueous) layer (about 400 ul) into a fresh tube.
8. Add 800 ul ethanol or 270 ul isopropanol and invert several times to precipitate DNA. The sample may be allowed to set at room temperature or 4C for 5-60 min to increase DNA yield. Longer periods will not affect DNA quality, but may slightly increase yield.
9. Centrifuge at 13000-16000 g for 10-20 min at room temperature.
10. Decant supernatant, air-dry pellet, and resuspend in 50-500 ul water.
